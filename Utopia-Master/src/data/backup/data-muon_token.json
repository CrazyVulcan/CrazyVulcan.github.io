A Muon Token stays wih a ship until it is removed.\n\n2. During the Activation Phase, after the ship moves, the ship takes damage to its Hull equal to the number of its current Maneuver -1. The type of Maneuver does not matter, just the number.\n\n3. After the ship performs a Green or White Maneuver, it can spend an Action to remove the Muon Token."
