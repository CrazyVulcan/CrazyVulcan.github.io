### Style Guide

These are general guidelines, not rules. I won't refuse a pull request just because it isn't the style that I use.

* Style guide: In general, follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide][styleguide].
* Line wrap: Soft-wrap at 80 characters (go further if wrapping makes code less readable).
* Indentation: Use tabs for indentation.
* JSDoc comments: Use [closure compiler annotations][jsdoc].
* Method chaining: Avoid long chained method statements, two or three max.
