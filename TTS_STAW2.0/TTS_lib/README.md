## TTS_lib
This repository holds all "libraries" I've created over time for TTS ([Tabletop Simulator](http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160) by Berserk Games).

For more info on each library, enter its folder - each should have its own README dsiplayed here with examples and such.

I heavily reccomend cloning this repository and using a smart include mechanism like ``#include`` contributed to [Atom Editor Plugin](https://github.com/Knils/atom-tabletopsimulator-lua) by [onelivesleft](https://github.com/onelivesleft/) (instead of just copy-pasting libs over scripts).
