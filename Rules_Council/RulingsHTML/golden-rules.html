			If a rule in this guide contradicts the Rulebook, the rule in this guide takes
			precedence.
			
			If the ability of a card conflicts with the rules in this guide, the card ability
			takes precedence.
			
			If a card ability uses the word “cannot,” that effect is absolute and cannot be
			overridden by other effects.
			
			During an attack or while otherwise resolving an effect involving dice, each die
			cannot be rerolled more than once.
