		<h1> Condition Cards </h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		Condition cards are cards assigned by ship and upgrade cards that represent
		persistent game effects. A condition card is not in play until a game effect
		assigns it to a ship. When a condition card is assigned, its text resolves.
		<br><br>
		After a ship is assigned a condition card, assign the associated condition
		marker to that ship as a reminder of the card’s persistent effect.
		<br><br>
		• A condition marker is removed when the corresponding condition card is
		removed.
		<br><br>
		• A condition that has been removed can be assigned again.
		<br><br>
		• Some condition cards are limited. If an effect assigns a player’s limited
		condition that is already in play, the condition card is removed and then
		assigned.
		<br><br>
		• When a ship is removed from the game, any condition cards assigned to
		that ship are not removed.
