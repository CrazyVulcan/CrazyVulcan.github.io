		A bomb is a type of device that is placed in the play area through a card effect
		from a <span class="icon-device"> upgrade card. The upgrade card that corresponds to the bomb
		has the “Bomb” trait at the top of its card text. Bombs can be dropped or
		launched during the System Phase and detonate at the end of the Activation
		Phase.
