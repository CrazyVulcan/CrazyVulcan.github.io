		<h1>Attack Range</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		During an attack, the attack range is determined by measuring range from
		the closest point of the attacker to the closest point of the defender that is in
		the attack arc.
		<br><br>
		â€¢ While measuring range for abilities that do not specify the attack range,
		the range between the attacker and the defender is measured from the
		closest point of the attacker to the closest point of the defender, ignoring
		the attack arc.
