		<h1> Destroying Ships </h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		A ship is <b>destroyed</b> after it has a number of damage cards that equals or
		exceeds its hull value. A destroyed ship is placed on its ship card.
		<br><br>
		• After a ship is destroyed in a phase other than the Engagement Phase, it
		is removed from the game.
		<br><br>
		• If a ship is destroyed during the Engagement Phase, it is removed after
		all ships that have the same initiative as the currently engaged ship have
		engaged, which is called simultaneous fire
		<br><br>
		• If an effect triggers after a ship is destroyed, the effect resolves
		immediately before the ship is removed.
		<br><br>
		• A destroyed ship’s abilities remain active until that ship is removed unless
		the ability specifies a different timing for the effect to end, such as “until
		the end of the Engagement Phase.” Such effects remain active until the
		end of the specified time.
