		<h1>Agility</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		A ship’s agility is the green number on its ship card. This value
		indicates the number of defense dice the ship rolls while it
		defends.
		<br><br>
		• During an attack, a ship with an agility value of “0” can still roll additional
		defense dice granted by game effects such as the range bonus, the attack
		being obstructed by an obstacle, or other card abilities.
		<br><br>
		• Abilities or game effects that cause a ship to roll additional or fewer
		defense dice do not modify the agility value of the defender.
		<br><br>
		• All modifiers to agility are cumulative. After all modifiers have been
		applied, if the number of defense dice required for a roll is less than “0,” it
		is treated as “0.”
