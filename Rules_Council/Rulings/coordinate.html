		Pilots can coordinate to assist their allies. When a ship performs the 󲁈
		action, it coordinates. A coordinating ship is a ship that is attempting to
		coordinate by performing the following steps:
		<br><br>
		1. Measure range from the coordinating ship to any friendly ships.
		<br><br>
		2. Choose another friendly ship at range 1–2.
		<br><br>
		3. The chosen ship performs one action.
		<br><br>
		Additionally:
		<br><br>
		• While a ship coordinates, the coordinate fails if no friendly ship can be
		chosen.
		<br>
		◊ If the chosen ship attempts to perform an action but that action fails,
		the coordinate does not fail.
		<br><br>
		• If an ability instructs a ship to coordinate, this is different than performing
		a <span class="icon-coordinate"> action. A ship that coordinates without performing the action can
		still perform the <span class="icon-coordinate"> action this round.
