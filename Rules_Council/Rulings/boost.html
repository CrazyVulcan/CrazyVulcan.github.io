		<h1>Boost (<span class="icon-boost">)</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		<b>Boost</b> represents a pilot activating additional thrusters to move farther
		forward. When a ship performs a <span class="icon-boost"> action, it boosts. A ship boosts by
		following these steps:
		<br><br>
		1. Choose the [1 <span class="icon-l-bank">], [1 <span class="icon-straight">], or [1 <span class="icon-r-bank">] template.
		<br><br>
		2. Set the template between the ship’s front guides.
		<br><br>
		3. Place the ship at the opposite end of the template and slide the rear
		guides of the ship into the template.
		<br><br>
		4. Return the template to the supply.
		<br><br>
		• When a player declares to boost a ship, that player also declares whether
		the ship is boosting straight, left, or right.
		<br><br>
		• While attempting to place a ship to complete a boost, the action can fail if
		any of the following occurs:
		<br>
		◊ The ship’s final positions would cause the ship to overlap another ship.
		<br>
		◊ The ship would overlap or move through an obstacle.
		<br>
		◊ The ship’s final position would cause it to be outside the play area (and
		therefore would cause that ship to flee).
		<br><br>
		• If a boost fails, the ship is returned to its prior position before it
		attempted the boost.
		<br><br>
		• The player cannot choose to fail a boost if the final position would not
		cause the action to fail.
		<br><br>
		• Performing a boost does not count as executing a maneuver but does
		count as a move.
		<br><br>
		• If an ability instructs a ship to boost, this is different than performing
		a <span class="icon-boost"> action. A ship that boosts without performing the action can still
		perform the <span class="icon-boost"> action this round.
