		<p>
		A ship <b>flees</b> if any part of its base is outside the play area after it executes a
		maneuver. A ship that flees is removed from the game.
		<br><br>
		• While a ship moves, the ship does not flee if only the template is outside
		the play area.
		<br><br>
		• Before a fleeing ship is removed from the game, the only effects it
		resolves before being removed from the game are effects that trigger
		when it flees.
		<br><br>
		• A ship cannot flee while resolving a boost, barrel roll, decloak, or SLAM.
		<br><br>
		• Partially executing a maneuver can cause a ship to flee if any part of its
		base is outside the play area after the maneuver
