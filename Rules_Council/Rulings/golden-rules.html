		<h1>Basic Maneuvers</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		The following bearings are for basic maneuvers. These maneuvers follow the
		standard rules for executing a maneuver.
		<br><br>
		• <b>Straight:</b> The <span class="icon-straight"> (straight) bearing advances a ship straight forward.
		<br>
		• <b>Bank:</b> The <span class="icon-"> (left bank) and <span class="icon-"> (right bank) bearings advance a ship at a
		shallow curve to one side, changing its facing by 45º.
		<br>
		• <b>Turn:</b> The <span class="icon-"> (left turn) and <span class="icon-"> (right turn) bearings advance a ship at a
		tight curve to one side, changing its facing by 90º.
		<br><br><br>
		<h1>Advanced Maneuvers</h1>
		<br><br>
		The following bearings are for advanced maneuvers. These have exceptions
		to the standard rules for executing a maneuver.
		<br><br>
		• <b>Koiogran Turn:</b> The <span class="icon-"> (Koiogran turn) bearing advances a ship straight
		forward, changing its facing by 180º. This uses the same template as the
		<span class="icon-"> maneuver.
		<br>
		◊ If the ship fully executes the maneuver, the player slides the ship’s front
		guides into the end of the template instead of the rear guides.
		<br>
		• <b>Segnor’s Loop:</b> The <span class="icon-"> (left Segnor’s Loop) and <span class="icon-"> (right Segnor’s Loop)
		bearings advance a ship at a shallow curve to one side, then reverses its
		facing. This uses the same template as the <span class="icon-"> and <span class="icon-"> maneuvers.
		<br>
		◊ If the ship fully executes the maneuver, the player slides the ship’s front
		guides into the end of the template instead of the rear guides.
		<br>
		• <b>Tallon Roll:</b> The <span class="icon-"> (left Tallon Roll) and <span class="icon-"> (right Tallon Roll) bearings
		advance a ship at a tight curve to one side, sharply changing its facing by
		180º. This uses the same template as the 󲁜 and 󲁠 maneuvers.
		<br>
		◊ If the ship fully executes the maneuver, before the player places the
		ship at the opposite end of the template, the ship is rotated 90º to the
		left for a <span class="icon-">, or 90º to the right for a 󲁦. Then the player places the ship
		with the hashmark on the side of the base aligned to the left, middle, or
		right of the end of the template, (similar to a barrel roll).
		<br><br>
		If a ship overlaps another ship while executing a Koiogran turn, Segnor’s Loop,
		or Tallon Roll, the ship partially executes the maneuver by using the rear
		guides as though it was executing the basic maneuver that uses the same
		template.
		<br><br>
		• <b>Stationary:</b> The <span class="icon-"> (stationary) bearing does not move the ship from its
		current position. This bearing does not have a corresponding template.
		<br>
		◊ A ship that executes this maneuver counts as executing a maneuver,
		does not overlap any ships, does trigger the effects of overlapping any
		obstacles at range 0, and continues to be at range 0 of any objects it
		was touching before executing this maneuver.
		<br>
		◊ Stationary maneuvers are not forward maneuvers.
		<br>
		◊ A ship that executes a stationary maneuver always fully executes the
		maneuver.
		<br><br>
		At the start of any type of reverse maneuver, instead of sliding the template
		between the front guides of the ship’s base, slide it between the rear guides.
		Additionally, when the ship is moved, the player slides the ship’s front guides
		into the end of the template instead of the rear guides.
		<br>
		• <b>Reverse Straight:</b> The <span class="icon-"> (reverse straight) bearing moves the
		ship straight backward. This bearing uses the same template as the <span class="icon-">
		maneuver.
		<br>
		◊ Reverse straight maneuvers are reverse maneuvers, not forward
		maneuvers.
		<br>
		• <b>Reverse Bank:</b> The <span class="icon-"> ( left reverse bank) and <span class="icon-"> (right reverse bank)
		bearing moves the ship at a shallow curve to one side, changing its facing
		by 45º. This bearing uses the same template as the <span class="icon-"> and <span class="icon-"> maneuvers.
		<br>
		◊ Reverse bank maneuvers are reverse maneuvers, not forward
		maneuvers.
