		<h1>Golden Rules</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
			If a rule in this guide contradicts the Rulebook, the rule in this guide takes
			precedence.
		<br><br>
			If the ability of a card conflicts with the rules in this guide, the card ability
			takes precedence.
		<br><br>
			If a card ability uses the word “cannot,” that effect is absolute and cannot be
			overridden by other effects.
		<br><br>	
			During an attack or while otherwise resolving an effect involving dice, each die
			cannot be rerolled more than once.
