		<h1> Dice Modification </h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		Players can modify dice by spending various tokens and by resolving abilities.
		Dice can be modified in the following ways:
		<br><br>
		• <b>Add</b>: To add a die result, place an unused die displaying the result next
		to the rolled dice. A die added in this way is treated as a normal die for all
		purposes and can be modified and canceled.
		<br><br>
		• <b>Change</b>: To change a die result, rotate the die so that its faceup side
		displays the new result.
		<br><br>
		• <b>Reroll</b>: To reroll a die result, pick up the die and roll it again.
		<br><br>
		• <b>Spend</b>: To spend a result, remove the die from the dice pool.
		<br><br><br>
		Additionally:
		<br><br>
		• Dice modification occurs during the respective Modify Attack Dice or
		Modify Defense Dice step, unless otherwise stated.
		<br><br>
		• Although dice can be modified by multiple effects, each die cannot be
		rerolled more than once.
		<br><br>
		• If an ability instructs a ship to spend a result, it cannot spend another
		ship’s results unless stated otherwise.
		<br><br>
		• Canceling dice is not a dice modification.
		<br><br>
		• Rolling additional dice or fewer dice is not a dice modification.
		<br><br>
		• If a die cannot be changed to a given result, nothing happens.
		<br>
		◊ For example, an attack die cannot be changed to an <span class="icon-evade"> result because
		that result does not appear on that die.
