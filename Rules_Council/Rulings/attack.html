		<h1>Attack</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		Ships can perform attacks which thematically represents the ship firing its
		blaster cannons, ordnance, or other weapons
		<br>
		If a ship performs an attack, it becomes the attacker then follows these steps:
		<br><br>
		1. <b>Declare Target:</b> During this step, the attacking player identifies and
		names the defender of the attack.
		<br>
		a. <b>Measure Range:</b> The attacking player measures range from the
		attacker to any number of enemy ships and determines which enemy
		ships are in which of its arcs.
		<br>
		b. <b>Choose Weapon:</b> The attacking player chooses one of the
		attacker’s primary or special weapons.
		<br>
		c. <b>Declare Defender:</b> The attacking player chooses an enemy ship
		to be the defender. The defender must meet the requirements defined
		by the weapon.
		<br>
		d. <b>Pay Costs:</b> The attacker must pay any costs for performing the
		attack.
		<br><br>
		• During the Declare Target step, the attack arc is the arc that corresponds
		to the chosen weapon. The attack range is determined by measuring
		range from the closest point of the attacker to the closest point of the
		defender that is in the attack arc.
		<br><br>
		• A primary weapon requires the attack range to be range 1–3. A primary
		weapon has no cost by default.
		<br><br>
		• Special weapons have different requirements specified by the source of
		the attack.
		<br><br>
		• If there is no valid target for the chosen weapon, or if the attacker cannot
		pay the costs required for the attack, the attacking player either chooses
		a different weapon or chooses not to attack.
		<br><br><br>
		2. <b>Attack Dice:</b> During this step, the attacking player rolls attack dice
		and the players can modify the dice.
		<br>
		a. <b>Roll Attack Dice:</b> The attacking player determines the number of
		attack dice to roll based on the chosen weapon’s attack value, range
		bonus, and any abilities that add or remove attack dice. Then they roll
		that many dice.
		<br>
		b. <b>Modify Attack Dice:</b> The players resolve abilities that modify the
		attack dice. The defending player resolves their abilities first, then the
		attacking player resolves their abilities.
		<br><br>
		• The most common ways the attacker modifies attack dice are by spending
		a focus token or spending a lock it has on the defender.
		<br><br>
		• Each attack die cannot be rerolled more than once during an attack.
		<br><br><br>
		3. <b>Defense Dice:</b> During this step, the defending player rolls a number
		of defense dice equal to the ship’s agility value and the players can modify
		the dice.
		<br>
		a. <b>Roll Defense Dice:</b> The defending player determines a number
		of defense dice to roll based on the defender’s agility value, as range
		bonus, whether the attack is being obstructed by an obstacle, and any
		abilities that increase or decrease the number of defense dice. Then
		they roll that many dice.
		<br>
		b. <b>Modify Defense Dice:</b> The players resolve abilities that modify
		the defense dice. The attacking player resolves their abilities first,
		then the defending player resolves their abilities.
		<br><br>
		• The most common ways the defender modifies defense dice are by
		spending a focus or evade token.
		<br><br>
		• Each defense die cannot be rerolled more than once during an attack.
		<br><br><br>
		4. <b>Neutralize Results:</b> During this step, pairs of attack and defense
		dice neutralize each other. Dice are neutralized in the following order:
		<br>
		a. Pairs of 󲁄 and 󲁧 results are canceled.
		<br>
		b. Pairs of 󲁄 and 󲁨 results are canceled.
		The attack hits if at least one 󲁧 or 󲁨 result remains uncanceled;
		otherwise, the attack misses.
		<br><br><br>
		5. <b>Deal Damage:</b> If the attack hits, the defender suffers damage for each
		uncanceled 󲁧 and 󲁨 result in the following order:
		<br>
		a. The defender suffers 1 󲁧 damage for each uncanceled 󲁧 result.
		Then cancel all 󲁧 results.
		<br>
		b. The defender suffers 1 󲁨 damage for each uncanceled 󲁨 result.
		Then cancel all 󲁨 results.
		<br><br><br>
		6. <b>Aftermath:</b> Abilities that trigger after an attack are resolved in the
		following order.
		<br>
		a. Resolve any of the defending player’s abilities that trigger “after you
		defend,” excluding abilities that grant a bonus attack.
		<br>
		b. Resolve any of the attacking player’s abilities that trigger “after you
		perform an attack,” excluding abilities that grant a bonus attack.
		<br>
		c. Resolve any of the defending player’s abilities that trigger “after you
		defend” that grant a bonus attack.
		<br>
		d. Resolve any of the attacking player’s abilities that trigger “after you
		perform an attack” that grant a bonus attack.
		<br><br>
		• Each ship may perform one attack when it engages during the
		Engagement Phase.
		<br><br>
		• If a ship is destroyed during the Engagement Phase, the ship is not
		removed until all ships of the attacker’s initiative have engaged.
		<br><br>
		• During an attack, a ship cannot choose to roll fewer dice than it is
		supposed to roll.
		<br><br>
		• If a player would roll more dice than they have available, keep track of the
		rolled results and reroll the dice necessary to equal the total number of
		dice the player would have rolled all at once. Note that these dice are not
		considered rerolled for the purposes of modifying dice.
