		<h1>Activation Phase</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		The Activation Phase is the third phase of a round. During this phase, each
		ship <b>activates</b>, one at a time, starting with the ship with the lowest initiative
		and continuing in ascending order.
		<br><br>
		Each ship activates by resolving the following steps in order:
		<br>
		1. <b>Reveal Dial:</b> The ship’s assigned dial is revealed by flipping it faceup
		and then placing it next to its ship card.
		<br><br>
		2. <b>Execute Maneuver:</b> The ship executes the maneuver selected on the
		revealed dial.
		<br><br>
		3. <b>Perform Action:</b> The ship may perform one action.
		<br><br>
		After all ships have activated, players proceed to the Engagement Phase.
		<br>
		• If a player has multiple ships with the same initiative value, that player
		activates them in any order—finishing the entire activation for one 
		before activating another ship of the same initiative value.
		<br><br>
		• If multiple players have ships with the same initiative value, player order
		is used to determine the sequence. The first player activates all of
		their ships with that initiative value in any order, then the second player
		activates all of their ships with that initiative value in any order.
		<br><br>
		• When a ship activates, if it skips the Reveal Dial step, it cannot resolve
		any abilities that trigger after the ship reveals its dial.
		<br><br>
		• A stressed ship cannot execute red maneuvers or perform actions.
		<br><br>
		• If a stressed ship attempts to execute a red maneuver, the ship executes
		a white [󲁞 2] maneuver instead.
