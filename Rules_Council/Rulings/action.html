		<h1>Actions</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		Ships can perform actions, which thematically represent things a pilot can do,
		such as repositioning slightly or flying defensively.
		<br><br>
		When a ship is instructed to perform an action, the ship can perform a
		standard action, which includes actions listed in that ship’s action bar,
		as well as abilities that have the “Action:” header on that ship’s condition,
		damage, ship, or upgrade cards.
		<br><br>
		• A ship cannot perform actions while stressed.
		<br><br>
		• Some upgrade cards have an action bar that lists one or more actions.
		<br>
		These actions are added to the ship’s action bar and therefore are
		standard actions that the ship can perform.
		<br><br>
		• Some ship and upgrade cards have a linked action bar which allows the
		ship to perform linked actions.
		<br><br>
		• Some actions can fail.
		<br><br>
		• Actions are either white or red. After a ship performs or fails a red
		action, it gains one stress token.
		<br>
		◊ If a ship is instructed to perform an action, the action is white unless
		stated otherwise.
		<br><br>
		• There is no maximum limit to the number of actions a ship can perform
		over the course of a round, but a ship cannot perform the same action
		more than once during a single round, or perform an action it has failed
		this round.
		<br>
		◊ If a ship has multiple damage cards with the same name, each damage
		card’s ability is a different action.
		<br>
		◊ Some cards have multiple “Action:” headers, each of which indicates a
		different action.
		<br>
		◊ Game effects such as “gain 1 focus token,” “boost,” or “acquire a lock”
		are not actions, and a ship can resolve these game effects any number
		of times each round. Game effects such as “perform a 󲁀 action,”
		<br><br>
		“perform a 󲁃 action,” or “perform a 󲁁 action” are actions, and
		therefore each ship can perform each of these actions only once per
		round.
		<br><br>
		• During the Perform Action step of a ship’s activation, the ship may
		perform an action.
		<br><br>
		• A ship can choose not to perform an action during the Perform Action
		step or when granted an action.
