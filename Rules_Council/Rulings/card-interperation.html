		<h1>Card Interpretation</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
			<h2>Use of “You”</h2>
			Many pilot and ship abilities use the word “you” to refer to the ship card’s
			corresponding ship. Upgrade, damage, and condition cards that use the word
			“you” refer to the ship to which the card has been dealt or equipped.
			Card effects that use “you” always refer to the ship, not the player.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Use of “May,” “Can,” and “Must”</h3>
			<br>
			The word “may” is used to mean “has the option to.” For example, an ability
			that says “At the start of the Engagement Phase, you may perform a <img src="*/Icons/roll.png"/>
			action,” means that the ship has the option to perform the action, but can
			also decline.
			<br><br>
			The word “can” is used to mean “has the capacity to.” For example, an ability
			that says “While you boost or barrel roll, you can move through and overlap
			obstacles” means when a ship with this ability boosts or barrel rolls, it ignores
			the rules that prevents them from overlapping or moving through obstacles.
			The ship always applies this effect as the effect is not optional but instead an
			expanded capability.
			<br><br>
			The word “must” is used to mean “is required to.” Although all effects that are
			not “may” effects are mandatory, the inclusion of “must” is used to reiterate a
			mandatory effect that could provide a drawback to the ship with the effect.
			Once Per Opportunity
			<br><br>
			Many abilities are restricted to occur “once per opportunity,” which means
			they can be resolved only one time during the specified timing window. For
			example, if an ability occurs “At the start of the Engagement Phase,” this
			ability can only be resolved once at the start of each Engagement Phase.
			As another example, if a ship has the ability “While you perform an attack,
			you may reroll 1 attack die,” it may resolve that ability once during each of its
			attacks.
			<br><br>
			<h3>And/Or</h3>
			<br>
			If an effect refers to results separated by slashes, it means any combination
			of those results. For example, if an ability refers to “2 <img src="*/Icons/hit.png"/>/<img src="*/Icons/crit.png"/> results” this
			would include two <img src="*/Icons/hit.png"/> results, two <img src="*/Icons/crit.png"/> results, or one <img src="*/Icons/hit.png"/> and one <img src="*/Icons/crit.png"/> result
