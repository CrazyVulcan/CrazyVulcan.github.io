		<h1> Charge (<span class="icon-charge"> AND <span class="icon-force">)</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p> 
		Some ship and upgrade cards have charges which are used to track limited
		resources such as the finite ammo of some weapons. There are two types of
		charges: <span class="icon-charge"> (standard charge) and <span class="icon-force"> (Force charge).
		<br><br>
		While standard charges can represent anything from limited munitions to
		exhaustible abilities that can only be performed infrequently, Force charges
		represent how some pilots or crew members can exert their influence over
		the Force.
		<br><br>
		Each card with a <b>charge limit</b> (the golden number) starts the game with a
		number of <span class="icon-charge"> equal to the charge limit. Each <span class="icon-charge"> starts on its active side.
		<br><br>
		Each card with a <b>Force capacity</b> (the purple number) starts the game with a
		number of <span class="icon-force"> equal to the Force capacity. Each <span class="icon-force"> starts on its active side.
		<br><br>
		While it performs an attack, a ship can spend any number of <span class="icon-force"> during the
		Attack Dice step to change that number of its <span class="icon-focus"> results to <span class="icon-hit"> results.
		<br><br>
		While it defends, a ship can spend any number of <span class="icon-force"> during the Defense Dice
		step to change that number of its <span class="icon-focus"> results to <span class="icon-evade"> results.
		<br><br>
		Some charge limits and all Force capacities have a
		<b>recurring charge symbol</b>. During the End Phase, each
		card with a recurring charge symbol recovers one charge.
		<br><br>
		• If an upgrade card has a charge limit, the <span class="icon-charge"> are placed above that
		upgrade card (not the ship card it is attached to).
		<br>
		◊ If an upgrade card instructs the ship to spend <span class="icon-charge">, those <span class="icon-charge"> are spent
		from that upgrade card.
		<br><br>
		• If an upgrade card has a Force capacity, this increases the Force capacity
		of the ship. The <span class="icon-force"> are placed above the ship card it is attached to (not
		the upgrade card).
		<br>
		◊ A ship card that does not have a Force capacity on its ship card has a
		Force capacity of “0,” but that capacity can be increased by upgrade
		cards that have a Force capacity.
		<br>
		◊ During the End Phase, each ship with a Force capacity recovers only
		one <span class="icon-force"> regardless of the number of recurring charge symbols that
		appear on its upgrade cards.
		<br>
		◊ If an upgrade card instructs the ship to spend <span class="icon-force">, those <span class="icon-force"> are spent
		from the ship card.
		<br><br>
		• When an effect instructs a ship to <b>recover</b> a charge, an inactive charge
		on that ship (ship or upgrade card) is flipped to its active side. A card
		cannot recover a charge if all of its charges are on their active side.
		<br><br>
		• When an effect instructs a ship to <b>lose</b> a charge, a charge assigned to
		the relevant card is flipped to the inactive side.
		<br><br>
		• When a ship <b>spends</b> a charge, that charge is flipped to its inactive side.
		A ship cannot spend a charge for an effect if all of its charges that are
		available for that effect are already inactive.
		<br><br>
		• Ship charges are charges on ship cards and upgrade charges are
		charges on upgrade cards.
		<br><br>
		• The <span class="icon-charge"> associated with charge limits that have the recurring charge
		symbol are called <b>recurring</b> charges. Alternatively <span class="icon-charge"> associated with
		charge limits that do not have the recurring charge symbol are called
		<b>non-recurring</b> charges
