		Pilots can evade to fly defensively. When a ship performs an <span class="icon-evade">
		action, it gains one evade token.
		<br><br>
		A ship is <b>evading</b> while it has at least one evade token. Evade
		tokes are circular, green tokens. While an evading ship defends, during the
		Modify Defense Dice step, it can spend one or more evade tokens to change
		that many of its blank or <span class="icon-focus"> results to <span class="icon-evade"> results.
		<br><br>
		â€¢ If an ability instructs a ship to gain an evade token, this is different than
		performing an <span class="icon-evade"> action. A ship that gains the token without performing
		the action can still perform the <span class="icon-evade"> action this round.
