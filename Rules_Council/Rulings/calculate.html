		Pilots can calculate, using advanced computing power to
		increase their combat performance. When a ship performs the
		<span class="icon-calcilate"> action, it gains one calculate token.
		A ship is calculating while it has at least one calculate token. Calculate
		tokens are circular, green tokens. A calculating ship follows these rules:
		• While a calculating ship performs an attack, during the Modify Attack Dice
		step, it may spend one or more calculate tokens to change that many of
		its <span class="icon-focus"> results to <span class="icon-hit"> results.
		• While a calculating ships defends, during the Modify Defense Dice step, it
		may spend one or more calculate tokens to change that many of its <span class="icon-calcilate">
		results to <span class="icon-evade"> results.
		Additionally:
		• A ship cannot spend calculate tokens to change <span class="icon-focus"> results to <span class="icon-hit"> or <span class="icon-evade">
		results if it does not have any <span class="icon-focus"> results.
		• If a card ability instructs a ship to gain a calculate token, this is different
		than performing a <span class="icon-calcilate"> action. A ship that gains the token without
		performing the action can still perform the <span class="icon-calcilate"> action this round.
