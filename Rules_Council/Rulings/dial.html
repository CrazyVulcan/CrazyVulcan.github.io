		<h1> Dial </h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		Each ship type has its own unique dial. All
		expansion products contain a dial for each
		ship in that product. Dials are used during
		the Planning Phase to secretly select
		maneuvers.
		<br><br>
		• When a player is instructed to set a
		ship’s dial, the player can choose the
		same maneuver that it already has selected unless stated otherwise.
		<br><br>
		• Players are not allowed to touch or look at their opponents’ facedown
		dials. If a player wishes to touch or look at their own facedown dial, they
		must inform their opponent they wish to do so before touching the dial.
		<br><br>
		• Each faction has its own <b>Maneuver Dial Upgrade Kit.</b> These dials
		assemble slightly differently than the standard dials and use a curved
		indicator below the maneuver instead to indicate selected maneuvers.
