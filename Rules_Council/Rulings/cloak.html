		<h1> Cloak (<span class="icon-cloak">) </h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		Ships can cloak to become difficult to hit, and they can decloak
		to move unpredictably. When a ship performs the 󲁅 action, it
		gains one cloak token.
		<br><br>
		A ship is cloaked while it has a cloak token. Cloak tokens are blue tokens.
		<br><br>
		A cloaked ship has the following effects:
		<br><br>
		• Its agility value is increased by 2.
		<br><br>
		• It is disarmed.
		<br><br>
		• It cannot perform the cloak action or gain a second cloak token.
		<br><br>
		During the System Phase, each cloaked ship may spend its cloak token to
		decloak. When a small ship decloaks, it must choose one of the following
		effects:
		<br><br>
		1. Barrel roll using the [2 <span class="icon-straight">] template.
		<br><br>
		2. Boost using the [2 <span class="icon-straight">] template.
		<br><br>
		When a medium or large ship decloaks, it must choose one of the following
		effects:
		<br><br>
		1. Barrel roll using the [1 <span class="icon-straight">] template.
		<br><br>
		2. Boost using the [1 <span class="icon-straight">] template.
		<br><br>
		• Decloaking does not count as executing a maneuver or performing an
		action but does count as a move.
		<br><br>
		• A ship can decloak even while stressed.
		<br><br>
		• When a player declares to decloak a ship, that player must declare which
		type of boost or barrel roll it is going to perform before placing a template
		on the play area.
		<br><br>
		• If a decloak fails, the ship is returned to its prior position before it
		attempted the decloak and the cloak token is not removed.
		<br><br>
		• Each ship cannot drop or launch a device during the same phase that it
		decloaked.
