		<h1> Damage </h1>

		<p>
		Damage represents the amount of structural damage a ship can take.
		Damage is tracked by damage cards. A ship is destroyed when the number of
		damage cards it has is equal to or greater than its hull value.
		<br><br>
		There are two types of damage: <span class="icon-hit"> (regular) damage and <span class="icon-crit"> (critical)
		damage. When a ship suffers damage, that damage is suffered one at a
		time. For each damage a ship suffers, it loses a shield by flipping the shield
		to its inactive side. If it does not have an active shield remaining, it is dealt a
		damage card instead. For <span class="icon-hit"> damage, the card is dealt <b>facedown</b>; for <span class="icon-crit">
		damage, the card is dealt <b>faceup</b> and its text is resolved. All <span class="icon-hit"> damage is
		suffered <b>before</b> <span class="icon-crit"> damage.
		<br><br>
		A ship is <b>damaged</b> while it has at least one damage card. A ship is
		<b>critically damaged</b> while it has at least one faceup damage card.
		<br><br>
		• If an effect instructs a player to deal a damage card to a ship, this is
		different from the ship suffering damage. The card is dealt to the ship
		regardless of whether the ship has any active shields.
		<br><br>
		• When a ship suffers damage or otherwise is dealt damage cards that
		would cause it to exceed its hull value, the excess damage cards are still
		dealt.
