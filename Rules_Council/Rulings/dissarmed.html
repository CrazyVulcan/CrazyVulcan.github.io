		<h1> Disarmed </h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		A ship is <b>disarmed</b> if it has at least one disarm token. A
		disarmed ship cannot perform attacks. The disarm token is a
		circular, orange token and is removed during the End Phase.
		<br><br>
		â€¢ During the Engagement Phase, disarmed ships still engage (although they
		cannot perform attacks).
