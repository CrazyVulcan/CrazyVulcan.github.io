		<h1>Bonus Attack</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		If a card instructs a ship to perform a bonus attack, it performs an additional
		attack during the Aftermath step.
		<br><br>
		• A few special weapons provide a bonus attack using the same weapon.
		While performing this type of bonus attack, the same arc requirements,
		range requirements, and cost requirements are followed unless stated
		otherwise.
		<br>
		◊ For example, a ship that attacked with the Cluster Missiles card can
		perform a bonus attack against another ship at range 1 of the defender
		and ignore the <span class="icon-lock"> requirement. The range (2–3), arc (<span class="icon-ArcF">), and cost
		(spending 1 <span class="icon-charge"> charge) are maintained for the bonus attack.
		<br><br>
		• A ship can perform only one bonus attack per round.
		<br><br>
		• If both players have a bonus attack that triggers after an attack, the
		defending player resolves their bonus attack first.
