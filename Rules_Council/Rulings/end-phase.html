		The End Phase is the fifth phase of the round. During the End Phase, all
		circular tokens are removed from all ships. Then, each card with a recurring
		charge icon recovers one charge.
		<br><br>
		• After this phase, the criteria for winning the game are checked.
		<br><br>
		• If the game did not end, the Planning Phase of the next round begins.
