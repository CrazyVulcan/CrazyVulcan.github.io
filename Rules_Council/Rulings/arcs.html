		<h1>Arc</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		An arc is an area formed between the lines created by extending hash marks
		or arc lines printed on a ship token to range 3. A ship is <b>in</b> an arc if any part
		of its base is inside that area.
		<br><br>
		• Arcs are measured beyond the base of ships. The portion of any object
		that lies beneath a ship is not in any of those ship’s arcs.
		<br><br><br>
		<h1>Standard Arcs</h1>
		<br><br>
		There are three types of <b>standard arcs</b> created from the crossed diagonal
		arc lines:
		<br><br>
		1. <b>Front arc</b> (󲈫): This arc projects in the same direction that the ship is
		facing. Most ships have a primary 󲈫 weapon. Almost all 󲁍, 󲁏, and 󲁐
		weapons use this arc.
		<br><br>
		2. <b>Side arcs</b> (󲐀, 󲐁): These arcs are on the left (󲐀) or right (󲐁) side
		of ships.
		<br><br>
		3. <b>Rear arc</b> (󲈪): This arc projects in the opposite direction that the ship
		is facing. Some ships have a primary 󲈪 weapon.
		<br><br><br>
		<h1>Bullseye Arcs</h1>
		<br><br>
		Inside of the front arc, each ship has a bullseye arc.
		<b>Bullseye arc</b> (󲈩): This arc is found inside the 󲈫. If something is in a
		ship’s 󲈩, it is also in its 󲈫.
		<br><br>
		• The 󲈩 is the width and length of the range ruler.
		<br><br>
		• There is no intrinsic effect when a ship attacks a ship in its 󲈩, but card
		abilities may refer to it.
		<br><br><br>
		<h1>Full Arcs</h1>
		<br><br>
		There are two <b>full arcs</b> that use the midway line instead of the printed arc
		lines.
		<br><br>
		1. <b>Full front arc</b> (󲈧): This arc covers all of the area in front of the ship.
		Some ships have primary 󲈧 weapons.
		<br><br>
		2. <b>Full rear arc</b> (󲈨): This arc covers all of the area behind the ship.
		Using the 󲈧, 󲈨, and extending the midway line to range 3, the following
		phrases are used to express specific spacial relationships between ships.
		<br><br>
		• <b>Behind:</b> If ship A is in the 󲈨 of ship B and ship A does not cross the
		midway line of ship B, then ship A is behind ship B.
		<br><br>
		• <b>In front of:</b> If ship A is in the 󲈧 of ship B and ship A does not cross
		the midway line of ship B, then ship A is in front of ship B.
		<br><br>
		• <b>Flanking:</b> If ship A crosses the midway line of ship B, then ship A is
		flanking ship B.
		<br><br><br>
		<h1>Turret Arcs</h1>
		<br><br>
		Unlike other arcs, some weapons use turret arc indicators to select arcs.
		There are two types of turret arc indicators: single turret (󲈭) and double
		turret (󲈬). During setup, a ship with a primary (or special) 󲈭 or 󲈬 weapon
		adds the corresponding turret arc indicator to its base.
		<br><br>
		The turret arc indicator points toward one of the ship’s four standard arcs.
		The standard arc that the turret arc indicator is pointing toward is a 󲈭 in
		addition to still being a standard arc. While a ship performs a 󲈭 attack, it can
		attack a target that is in its 󲈭 arc.
		<br><br>
		A ship with a double turret arc indicator has two 󲈭 in
		opposite directions.
		<br><br>
		A ship can adjust which standard arc(s) that its turret arc
		indicator is pointing towards by using the rotate (󲁫) action.
		<br><br><br>
		<h1>Firing Arcs</h1>
		<br><br>
		A ship’s <b>firing arcs</b> include all shaded arcs on the ship’s ship token plus all
		󲈭 arcs, if any.
		<br>
		• If an upgrade card gives a ship a 󲈭 arc or primary weapon with a specified
		arc, those arcs are also firing arcs.
