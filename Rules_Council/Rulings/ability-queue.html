		<h1>Ability Queue</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
			The ability queue is used to resolve the timing of multiple abilities that
			trigger during the same timing window. Abilities are resolved from the front
			of the queue to the back of the queue. These abilities are added to the back of
			the ability queue using the following rules:
			<br><br>
			1. If both players have abilities that triggered from the same event, the
			abilities are added to the ability queue in player order.
			<br><br>
			2. If a player has multiple abilities that triggered from the same event, that
			player chooses the order that those abilities are added to the ability
			queue.
			<br><br>
			3. If resolving an effect from the ability queue triggers additional effects, they
			are added to the front of the ability queue using the above rules.
			See Appendix for 2 examples of the ability queue.
			<br>
			• If there are game effects that share the same timing window as a player’s
			ability, the game effect is resolved first.
			<br>
			◊ For example, if a ship performs a red barrel roll and the ship has an
			ability that triggers after it performs a barrel roll, the ship gains a
			stress token before the other ability is resolved.
