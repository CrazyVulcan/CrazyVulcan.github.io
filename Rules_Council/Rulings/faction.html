		<h1> Faction </h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		There are currently three factions in the game: Rebel (The Rebel Alliance),
		Imperial (The Galactic Empire), and Scum (Scum and Villainy). All ship cards
		and some upgrade cards are aligned to one of these factions. A squad cannot
		typically contain cards from different factions.
		<br><br>
		â€¢ Upgrade cards can be used by any faction unless they have a restriction.
