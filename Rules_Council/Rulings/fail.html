		<br><br>
		<p>
		Some effects can <b>fail</b>, which means the effect did not resolve as intended and
		instead is resolved in a default way.
		<br><br>
		• A ship can fail when it barrel rolls<span class="icon-b-roll">, boosts<span class="icon-boost">, coordinates<span class="icon-coordinate">, decloaks, deploys,
		jams<span class="icon-jam">, locks<span class="icon-lock">, or SLAMs<span class="icon-slam">.
		<br><br>
		• An effect that fails does not trigger any effects that would occur after a
		ship resolves that effect.
		<br><br>
		• If an action fails, the player does not choose a different action to perform
		and cannot choose to resolve the effect in a different way.
		<br><br>
		• If an action fails, since the action was not completed, that ship cannot
		perform a linked action.
		<br><br>
		• After a red action fails, the ship gains a stress token.
