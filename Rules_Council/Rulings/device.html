		<p>
		Each <span class="icon-device"> (device) upgrade card allows a ship to drop or launch a specific type
		of device and provides additional rules for how that device behaves.
		To drop a device, follow the steps below:
		<br><br>
		1. Take the template indicated on the upgrade card.
		<br><br>
		2. Set the template between the ship’s rear guides.
		<br><br>
		3. Place the device indicated on the upgrade card into the play area and
		slide the guides of the device into the opposite end of the template. Then
		remove the template.
		<br><br><br>
		To <b>launch</b> a device, follow the steps below:
		<br><br>
		1. Take the template indicated on the upgrade card.
		<br><br>
		2. Set the template between the ship’s front guides.
		<br><br>
		3. Place the device indicated on the upgrade card into the play area and
		slide the guides of the device into the opposite end of the template. Then
		remove the template.
		<br><br><br>
		Some devices can detonate. When a device <b>detonates</b>, an effect triggers
		depending on the type of device.
		<br><br>
		• See Appendix for examples of dropping and launching.
		<br><br>
		• Most devices are placed during the System Phase.
		<br><br>
		• One side of each device has a white boarder to help distinguish which
		player it belongs to.
		<br><br>
		• Each ship can drop or launch only one device per round.
		<br><br>
		• Each ship cannot drop or launch a device during the same phase that it
		decloaked.
		<br><br>
		• Devices are not obstacles but are objects.
		<br><br>
		• If a device is placed overlapping a ship, it is placed under the ship’s base.
		<br><br>
		• If a device that detonates when overlapped is placed under more than
		one ship’s base, it detonates instantly and the player placing the device
		chooses which ship it affects.
		<br><br>
		• The guides on a device count as part of the device for the purposes of
		measuring range to or from it as well as overlapping and moving through
		it.
		<br><br>
		• A device cannot be placed so that a portion of the device would be outside
		the play area. If this would happen, play is reversed to before the device
		was placed—the device is not placed, any charges spent are recovered,
		and the player can choose to not place that device.
		<br><br>
		• If a ship partially executes a maneuver, only the portion of the template
		that is between the starting and final position of the ship is counted for
		the purpose of moving through or overlapping a device. Ignore the portion
		of the template that the ship moved backward along when resolving the
		maneuver.
