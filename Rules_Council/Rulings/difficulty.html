		<h1> Difficulty </h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		Each maneuver has three components: speed (a number 0–5), difficulty (red,
		white, or blue), and bearing (an arrow or other symbol).
		<br><br>
		During the Check Difficulty step of executing a maneuver, if the maneuver
		is red, the ship gains one stress token; if the maneuver is blue, the ship
		removes one stress token.
		<br><br>
		• A stressed ship cannot execute red maneuvers or perform actions.
		<br><br>
		• If an effect increases the difficulty of a maneuver, blue increases to white,
		and white increases to red. If an effect decreases the difficulty of a
		maneuver, red decreases to white, and white decreases to blue.
		<br>
		◊ An ability that increases the difficulty of a red maneuver or decreases
		the difficulty of a blue maneuver can resolve, but has no additional
		effect.
		<br>
		◊ If multiple abilities change the difficulty of a maneuver, the effects are
		cumulative. For example, if a ship reveals a red [4 <span class="icon-straight">] maneuver and
		has one effect that increases the difficulty of the maneuver and another
		effect that decreases the difficulty of the maneuver, the maneuver is
		treated as red.
