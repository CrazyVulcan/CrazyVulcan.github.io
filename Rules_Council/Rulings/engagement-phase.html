		<br><br>
		<p>
		The Engagement Phase is the fourth phase of the round. During this phase,
		each ship <b>engages</b>, one at a time, starting with the ship with the highest
		initiative and continues in descending order.
		<br><br>
		When a ship engages, it may perform an attack.
		<br><br>
		• After all ships of a given initiative have engaged, all destroyed ships are
		removed. Then, continuing in descending order, this process continues
		with all ships of the same initiative engaging and then removing all
		destroyed ships.
		<br><br>
		• If a player has multiple ships with the same initiative, the player engages
		them in any order, engaging one ship before engaging another ship of the
		same initiative value.
		<br><br>
		• If multiple players have ships with the same initiative, player order is used
		to determine the order. The first player engages all of their ships of a
		given initiative before the second player engages all of their ships of that
		initiative.
		<br><br>
		• Disarmed ships still engage even though they cannot perform attacks.
		<br><br>
		• Each ship engages only once during this phase.
