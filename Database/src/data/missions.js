//	specialRules: "<b>SPECIAL RULES\n\nRAW MATERIALS TOKENS (RMT)</b>\n These tokens represent the raw materials located on the planet’s surface that may be transformed into weapons. They may be accumulated each round by each fleet’s Away Team by using their ships’ Actions. RMTs will be used to enhance the number of a Captain’s attack dice during the “Captains’ Battle” that occurs once every Captain is on the planet’s surface (see below).\n\n<b>AWAY TEAM TOKENS</b>\n\nDuring the End Phase of each round, remove 1 of the Mission Tokens from the game.\n\n Each time a Mission Token is removed, both players must place an Away Team Token on one of their Captain Cards. The chosen Captain Card from each fleet must be the one with the highest Skill Number that does not already have an Away Team Token on it (the player chooses if there is a tie). These Captains are now considered to be a part of that player’s Away Team and on the planet’s surface. STAR TREK TM: ATTACK WING The Original Series OP Event \n\n Overview: Arena On what was to be a routine mission to check the status of the outpost on planet Cestus III, you find that the outpost has been destroyed and you are suddenly ambushed by the enemy forces on the planet. Thinking quickly, you thwart the ambush and return to your ships. A battle ensues between your fleets. Suddenly, the battle is stopped and your Captains are vanishing from your ships. The Metrons, a highly advanced race of beings, have placed your fleets into their “arena” in an uncharted solar system. They have prepared a planet of suitable atmosphere and begin taking your Captains from their ships and transporting them onto the planet. The surface of the planet will provide the raw materials for the Captains to construct weapons with which to battle each other. The Metrons have declared that the victorious Captains will be allowed to return to their ships and determine the fate of both fleets. \n\n While a Captain is part of an Away Team, a player cannot use that Captain’s text ability (if any) or any Elite Talent Upgrades on that Captain’s Ship. In addition, any ship whose Captain is part of an Away Team is considered to have a Captain Skill of “1”. \n\n Captains that are part of an Away Team are not destroyed if their ship is destroyed. \n\n When the last Mission Token is removed from the game, both players must place an Away Team Token on all remaining Captain Cards in their fleets that do not already have an Away Team Token on them. \n\n The Planet Token and all remaining ships are then removed from the play area. All Tokens that were beside those ships are returned to the Action Token Supply. The battle in space is suspended and the Captains’ Battle begins (see ‘Captains’ Battle’ below).\n\n\n\n<b>PLANET TOKEN</b> Treat this as a regular Planet Token (see page 23 in the Rules of Play). Any ship within Range 1-2 of the Planet Token may perform the following Action: <b>ACTION:</b> Target 1 of your Captains in your Away Team. Roll 1 attack die for every point of that Captain’s Skill Number. For every [Battle Stations] result, place 1 Raw Materials Token onto that Captain’s Card (min 1). NOTE: Each Captain in your Away Team may only be targeted by this Action once per round. \n\n<b>CAPTAINS’ BATTLE</b> When the last Mission Token is removed from the game, the players’ Away Teams are forced to battle each other. Captains attack one-at-a-time in descending order of their Captain Skill (high to low). If 2 or more Captains have the same Skill Number, resolve their attacks following the same initiative rules used in Ship Combat (see pg 21 in the Full Rules of Play). Follow these steps for each Captain’s attack starting with the player whose Captain has the highest Skill Number: \n1) The attacker spends one RMT from the Captain Card and rolls 6 attack dice. If there are no RMTs on that Captain Card, the attacker rolls 3 attack dice. \n\n2) The defender must then assign damage to one of his Captains (of his choice) equal to the number of [Hit] and [Critical Hit] results. Mark the damage to the Captains with face down cards from the Damage Deck.\n\n NOTE: All of the damage from a single attack must be assigned to a single Captain. \n\n3) When a Captain receives a number of Damage Cards equal to or greater than his Skill Number that Captain is immediately destroyed and that Captain Card is removed from the game. Remove all of the Damage Cards from that Captain Card and place them under the Damage Deck. \n\n4) The player whose Captain has the next highest Skill Number attacks next. Once all of the Captains have attacked, repeat the steps above starting with the Captain with the highest Skill Number. Play continues in this manner until all of the Captain Cards from one player’s fleet are destroyed. If both players’ Captains are destroyed in the same attack (see ‘Simultaneous Attack Rule’ on pg 17 in the Rules of Play), each player rolls 5 dice. The player with the most [Battle Stations] results is considered the victor of the Captains’ Battle. \n\n AFTERMATH Once the Captains’ Battle is over, return all of the Damage Cards from the Captains to the Damage Deck and reshuffle the Damage Deck. The \n\n VICTORIOUS PLAYER then resets the entire play area with the following limitations: \n1) Away Team Tokens are removed from all remaining Captains. These cards are no longer considered part of an Away Team. The victorious player may reassign his Captains to his ships as he sees fit (one per ship), and any extra Captains are placed beneath one of his ship cards (of his choice). These cards will count towards a player’s surviving fleet if that ship survives the battle. \n\n2) The Planet Token is placed anywhere within the play area, but not within 4” of any edge of the play area. \n\n3) All of the ships that were removed are positioned back in the play area by the victorious player without any Tokens beside them (except for Critical Hit Tokens where appropriate). No ship may be placed within 4” of any Token, Ship or any edge of the play area. \n\nNOTE: All ships that were damaged or destroyed prior to the Captains’ Battle remain equally damaged or destroyed. The battle in space resumes between the remaining ships and play continues until one player is eliminated or the time limit is reached.",
