Global todo:
- [ ] trying to cut out the dead space on the cards seeing as there are no pictures. 
- [x] One small suggestion: The set viewer links to the builder. It would be nice if the builder had a link back to the viewer.
- [ ] Not to pile on, but if you're going to mess with the Expansions list functionality, how about a filter? Maybe a drop down for Faction with an option for Resources/Other (thinking the Redshirt and Full Alert cards here?) That would be super helpful.
- [ ] card picturs
- [x] test


Cards that need functionality:
- [x] test1
- [ ] test2
