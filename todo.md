Global todo:
- [ ] trying to cut out the dead space on the cards seeing as there are no pictures. 
- [X] One small suggestion: The set viewer links to the builder. It would be nice if the builder had a link back to the viewer.
- [ ] Not to pile on, but if you're going to mess with the Expansions list functionality, how about a filter? Maybe a drop down for Faction with an option for Resources/Other (thinking the Redshirt and Full Alert cards here?) That would be super helpful.
- [ ] card picturs
- [ ] Would it be possible to show the token effect cards with the cards that place special tokens - similar to linked ship and manveuer cards
- [X] The Temporal Cold War grand prize cards

Spellchecking:
- [X] Waves 0-3
- [ ] Waves 4-23
- [X] OP Kits (The Dominion War, Khan GenCon, The Tholian Web, The Collective, Resistance is Futile)
- [ ] OP Kits (A Matter of Honor, The Q-Continuum, Peak Performance, Year of Hell, Balance of Terror, Temporal Cold War, The Void, The Doomsday Machine)
- [ ] 2015-16 Reinforcement Blind Ships

Cards that need functionality:
- [X] test1
