SETUP:

To make your custom card site you will need 3 things. 

1) Node.js Node Project Manager https://nodejs.org/en/ Simpaly download and install in its defalt location

2) Once that is installed open it useing your command prompt (not the app) this will allow you to interface 
with windows and do the next needed steps. 

3) Install the https-server  https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
in the command prompt type the folowing command   'npm install http-server -g'
this will install the http-server gloably in your AppData folder found in C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Roaming\npm
[you may have to turn on the ability to see hidden folders] 

4) Move this folder to this new file location inside your AppData Roaming

5) back in the command prompt you need to start your http-server simply enter the command 'http-server ./[UserName]/AppData/Roaming/npm/UtopiaCardMaker'

6) You can now launch your browser and go to the url http://localhost:8081/UtopiaCardMaker/ 
note port 8080 is the defalt and when you add the new folder it often changes to 8081 but will tell you the port number to use in the prompt. 

(If you see Utopia congrats you folowed the above directions correctly) 

MAKING CARDS:

The prosses of making new cards is rather straight forward. The first thing you will need is a file editor such as Noatpad++ or other that 
can help with json markup and debugging. 

There are two basic examples in Wave 0 for demo. One is a templat format and the other is a Example Bioship Card Pack.

The first thing we will make is a new set. JSON works in catagorys so alwasy add the newest to the end of the row. We will copy the 
example Set and edit it to what you want. 

{
	"type": "set",
	"id": "setnum",
	"name": "Your Set Name",
	"releaseDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
	"parentSet": "Wave 0"
}

Never edit the "type" and the last instance in a JSON string can not have a comma 


{
	"type": "set",
	"id": "vengence",
	"name": "U.S.S. Vengence",
	"releaseDate": "2019-05-10",
	"parentSet": "Wave 1"
}

Next we will design a ship of a new class and the card for that ship

{
	"type": "ship",
	"id": "uss_vengence_vengence",
	"set": ["vengence"],
	"name": "U.S.S. Vengence",
	"class": "Vengence Class",
	"actions": ["evade", "target-lock", "scan", "battlestations"],
	"upgrades": ["tech", "weapon", "weapon", "crew", "crew"],
	"attack": 5,
	"agility": 0,
	"hull": 6,
	"shields": 4,
	"cost": 30,
	"text": "<b>During the Gather Forces Step</b> You may equip 1 [weapon] or [tech] upgrade hidden for a cost of excatly 3sp. This Upgrade can not be restricted to a specific faction",
	"unique": true,
	"factions": ["federation", "indipendent"]
}

when describing text use <b> for bold and <i> for itillicised you can force a break in the text by useing \n for a new line and all 
icons are in [] such as [crew] [hit] [aux] ect see bottom for a full list of icons used

Now we will need to design the ship class and maneuver template. 

{
	"type": "ship-class",
	"id": "ship_class_vengence",
	"name": "Vengence Class",
	"frontArc": "180",
	"maneuvers": {
		"1": {
			"straight": "green",
			"bank": "green"
		},
		"2": {
			"straight": "green",
			"bank": "white",
			"turn": "white"
		},
		"3": {
			"straight": "white",
			"bank": "white",
			"turn": "red"
		},
		"4": {
			"straight": "white"
		},
		"5": {
			"straight": "white"
		},
		"min": -2,
		"max": 5,
		"-2": {
			"straight": "red"
		}
	}
}
